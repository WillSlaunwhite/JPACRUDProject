# JPACRUDProject
Will Slaunwhite

### Overview
This is our first solo full stack Web Application, a pretty big achievement. It's
pretty crazy to think that 10 weeks ago I'd never really read or written Java before.

The purpose of this project is to model the information of the current players of the
San Franciso 49ers. The user should be able to create, read, update and delete players
on the roster. The information for the original set of 49ers players is stored in a
mysql database then read into Java using JPQL.

Ultimately, I'd like the website to reflect a nicer css structure and be structured
better in general, but those are things I'll work on going forward.

### How to Use
The application launches to index where the user has options to look at all players,
search by first or last name, add a player, delete a player, or update a player.
Everything works as it should, except for update player which updates every player in
the table.

### Conclusion
The vast majority of issues I've encountered were regarding updating and deleting players.
I had update working fully at some point but I spiraled down some rabbit hole and
next thing I knew nothing worked and I couldn't fix it.

Learned a lot about troubleshooting, how the code is put together and just the
structure of JPA projects in general. I will most certainly continue to expand on
this going forward.
